This project was built using the Blazor WebAssembly App template from the
.NET 7 SDK. In .NET 8, the Blazor templates changed a bit - the closest 
equivalent in the .NET 8 templates would be Blazor Web App and 
selecting WebAssembly as the interactive render mode with the 
interactivity location set to Global. 

With the .NET 8 template, the project structure will be a bit 
different. In .NET 8, there is no "Shared" project - 
just a Client and Server project, where the "shared" items 
must go in the Client project.
